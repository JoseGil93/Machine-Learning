# Machine Learning
* This Repository contains 3 Projects that I have developed during this Unit in my Master's Degree:
* I have developed the following projects in Python through Jupyter, Anaconda. 

1. [Image Recognition: PCA, Unsupervised Learning Project](https://github.com/JoseGil93/Machine-Learning/blob/master/SIT720_A1_218659676%20(2).pdf)

* In this project, an Unsupervised Learning Task was developed, by using K-Means for Clustering and PCA for Dimensionality Reduction. 

2. [Breast Cancer Diagnosis and Handwritten digits Classifications: Binary and Multiclass Classification](https://github.com/JoseGil93/Machine-Learning/blob/master/SIT720_A1_218659676%20(2).pdf)

* This Project consisted in 2 main parts, the first part is from a Dataset about Breast Cancer Diagnosis Data from Wisconsin, used in a Kaggle Competition. For the First part of this
project, the data was explored and feature engineering was applied by using normalization and standardizaton. Secondly, 2 logistic Regression models 
were trained with certain parameters and tested with the performance metrics. Then, there was a hyperparameter tuning and the results of the performance metrics such as 
Precicion, Recall, Accuracy, Confusion Matriz, were compared. 

* For the second main part, Multiclass Classification, it was used an unstructured data of handwritten digits. Thus, descriptive statistics was performed with data exploration, 
then the data was split for training the data using Logistic Regression for multiclass classification of Supervised Learning, and the models were optimised by tuning the hyperparameters, in
which the performance metrics shows the results obtained.
